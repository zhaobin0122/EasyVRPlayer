Source code license
This code (Live555) is "open source", and is released under the LGPL. This allows you to use these libraries (via linking) inside closed-source products.
It also allows you to make closed-source binary extensions to these libraries - for instance, to support proprietary media codecs that subclass the existing "liveMedia" class hierarchy.
Nonetheless, we hope that subclass extensions of these libraries will also be developed under the LGPL, and contributed for inclusion here.

We encourage developers to contribute to the development and enhancement of these libraries.
