voice_tip_content="Hi Nibiru" is a wake-up words, purely used to wake up \nspeech recognition.After that, you need to rely on online \nrecognition to get the result. If the result is defined \nin your code,then the logic is executed.\n(so the demo defines the ‘move right’ logic)

voice_say_content_left=Say 'Hi Nibiru, Move Left'
voice_say_content_volume=Please say "Volume Up"
voice_tip_content_v="Volume Up" is a wake-up word for the predefined logic of \nthe SDK (there is no need to say" Hi Nibiru ") and the \ncorresponding logic is automatically executed when the \nrecognition result exactly matches it, without the \ndeveloper having to define it in the code. 
next_demo_text=Next
last_demo_text=Last
start_rec=Start Recording
stop_rec=Stop Recording
voice_status_cancel=Recognition Canceled
api_desc=This is an example of an interface that performs voice recognition. \nFor a detailed description of the interface, see the development documentation .\n In addition to wake-up words and interface calls,\n you can use the device's voice-activated keys. \n See the Hardware Guide in the switch documentation for details. \nThe voice keys defined by different models may differ \n (or may not have a voice key)
